## How to get the most from your email

The average worker spends [28% of the work day reading and answering email](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-social-economy), according to a McKinsey analysis. That amounts to a staggering 2.6 hours per day.

If you feel like you are spending too much time in your inbox here are some tips and tricks so you can be more efficient with your email.

**Turn off email notifications**  
Email an be a huge distraction if you let it so take control of how the flow of incoming messages fits into your day. Turn off notifications to prevent constant distraction when you are working on other tasks and only check your email when it is convenient for you. If you are worried that you will miss something urgent, set up an automated response to incoming email to let your customers know that can call you if the matter is urgent.

**Set aside time for email**  
Now you are not constantly being distracted by your email notifications set aside time each day for incoming email. Some business owners find it best to do it once at the start of the day and once at the end of the day while some find more frequent pockets work best.

**Delete first**  
When you first open your inbox each day, the first thing you should do is delete any unnecessary messages without opening them at all. Do this before you get into reading any of your emails and remember your bin doesnâ€™t delete the emails straight away so you can always go and pick them up again if needed.

**Be smart with your smartphone**  
Many small business owners are ofter out and about during the day and travelling between clients can be a great time to take a look at your inbox. Just deleting messages to leave you with ones you need to action when you have more time can be a great way to have a more streamlined inbox when you get back to the office.

**Unsubscribe often**
If you find you have lots email newsletters cluttering up your inbox consider unsubscribing. Newsletters can be a great way to keep up to date with clients and competitors but these emails can quickly take up a large percentage of your inbox. If you have signed up to a lot of newsletters and want a drastic clean up there are tools like [cleanfox](https://www.cleanfox.io/en/) that can help.

**Automate as much as you can**  
To streamline your emails even further, use rules in your email to automatically label, archive, delete, or star your emails. There is an initial time commitment to think about what rules you might need but once set up it can save a huge amount of email processing time. There are really simple guides for [Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en-GB) and [Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-up-rules-in-outlook-75ab719a-2ce8-49a7-a214-6d62b67cbd41) that show you how to set up rules

**Build a workflow for new customer emails**
If new customer queries are a large percentage of your inbox and you have a manual process for taking action on these new queries it might be time to consider a new workflow. Tools like [Streak](https://www.streak.com/) can help you build a new workflow that put new customer queries into a sales pipeline automatically and keeps everything in your inbox.
